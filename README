## Git-O-Mator

  Simple scripts to help automate a Git based work flow.

## New_repo script ############################################################

  ## Configuration

  You will need to replace REMOTE_USER="admin" with an actual user on your 
  hosting account, adjust REMOTE_HOST="123.456.123.456" to point to your 
  accounts IP address, and edit REMOTE_REPO_PATH="/home/admin/repos/" with 
  whatever path you wish to contain your Git repositories on your remote host.

  Once that is done, provide the script with executable permissions.

  $ chmod +x new_repo

  Optionally add the location to your PATH.  That's it. 

  ## Usage

  $ ./new_repo testing

  You will end up with /home/user/repos/testing.git on your remote host, 
  and ./testing locally. From ./testing you can git push to send commits to 
  the remote repository, and git pull to retrieve from the remote repository.
